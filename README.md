# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## Description
This project involves predicting the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**. The project utilizes a dataset obtained from the **YBI Foundation's GitHub account**. It focuses on data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found in the YBI Foundation's GitHub repository. It includes various health indicators that contribute to predicting diabetes. Ensure you have internet access when running the script, as it loads the dataset directly from the URL.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rithika-Shankar/diabetes-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python diabetes_prediction.py
   
## Output
The model's performance metrics, including a confusion matrix and classification report, are printed in the console. The output will provide insights into the model's accuracy and other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Additionally, the model can predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on their health indicators.
